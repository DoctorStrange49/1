# Telegram-Click-Bot
Python automation script for Telegram Crypto Click Bots.

The script supports Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Zcash and BCH click bots.
To use the script, you need to first get a telegram API id and hash and include it in the script.
.

## Using the Script
The script is run from the command line with the following optional arguments:

1. 'check': This checks if user is authourised on telegram.
2. 'auth': This authourises the user. You must do this before using the script.
3. 'cache': This is important to avoid authourising every time you run to script which could lead to temporary ban from telegram.
4. 'inf': This ensures the script runs until you manually quit it from the command line.
